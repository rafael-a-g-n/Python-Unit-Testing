## About the Project

This repository showcases a fundamental understanding of **Unit Testing in Python** using the built-in `unittest` framework. It features a simple Python module (`mymodule.py`) with basic mathematical operations (`square`, `double`, `add`), accompanied by a comprehensive test suite (`test_mymodule.py`) that ensures the correctness and reliability of these functions.

This project serves as an excellent example of how to implement robust unit tests, handle various input types, and maintain code quality through automated testing.

## Features

- **Mathematical Operations:** Provides core functions for squaring, doubling, and adding numbers.
- **Comprehensive Unit Tests:** Thorough testing of each function using `unittest`.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Tests include positive, negative, float, and zero inputs, as well as string concatenation for the `add` function.
- **Clear Test Structure:** Organized test classes and methods for maintainability and readability.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used.
- **`unittest` Framework:** Python's built-in unit testing framework for creating and running tests.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system.

```bash
python --version
```

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rafael-a-g-n/Python-Unit-Testing.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Python-Unit-Testing
    ```

## Running Tests

To execute the unit tests and verify the functionality:

```bash
python -m unittest test_mymodule.py
```

## Skills Demonstrated
